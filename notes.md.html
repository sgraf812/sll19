Solving Data-flow problems in syntax trees

# First slide

- (0:23)
- Thanks for having me here and for this great opportunity to give a talk
- I'm ...
- originally, I planned to talk about my recently finished master's thesis
- decided that's a talk I'd probably fall asleep to
- so instead this will be about an interesting byproduct of my thesis that should be more fun to follow

# Introduction

- 2 minutes (1:17)
- So, what exactly was my thesis about?
- Two analyses in GHC, CA and DA, that overlap in concerns
- I extracted overlapping logic into a combined Usage Analysis generalising CA and its counterpart in DA
- Surprising result: Precision of CA achievable without co-call graphs
- Now, if those words don't mean anything to you, fear not, you won't hear them again
- Otherwise or if you are interested, I encourage you to skim through my master's thesis here
- Marrying Call Arity with the Demand Analyser required quite a complex analysis order at let bindings
- In particular, GHC's analyses are typically implemented as iterative traversals of the syntax tree
- proved to be too restrictive
- Had to decouple specification of data-flow problem from computing its solution
- Sounds vague, I know
- But we'll go over the details by the example of a strictness analysis

# Strictness Analysis

- 1 minute (1:07)
- provides lower bounds on *evaluation cardinality*
- Specifically, it answers the question of which variables are evaluated at least once
- Answer to that captured in a property called the variables strictness
- `Strict` is the analysis' way of saying 'Yes, I'm sure this is evaluated at least once'
- While `Lazy` is the conservative 'Probably not, but I'm not really sure'
- So for the example program below we can find out that:  
  - `x` and `y` are evaluated strictly
  - wheras `z` is evaluated lazily, because it won't be evaluated at all if `y` is odd
- The compiler can take advantage of that knowledge by using Call by Value without changing the semantics
- (bang patterns)
- Also it could unbox strict variables

# GHC's Demand Analyser

- 1 minute (0:46)
- GHC performs strictness analysis in its Demand Analyser
- Strictness annotations are most important for the worker/wrapper transformation, which is responsible for unboxing
- Demand Analysis works by:  
  - Finding out, for each expression, which free variables are used strictly 
  - and for each function which arguments are used strictly
- Analysis information is captured in an expression's strictness type:  
  - an environment for strictness on free variables
  - a list of strictness indicators for arguments

# Strictness signatures

- 1 minute (0:58)
- Interesting to see how a Strictness Analysis in the style of the Demand Analyser handles let-bindings
- Demand Analysis annotates bindings with their strictness signature
- This is the signature for `const`
- We see that `const` does nothing interesting with free variables
- but uses its first argument strictly, whereas its second argument is not used at all and thus lazily
- At the call site we can unleash the strictness type stored in `const`s signature to see that `y` is used strictly and the `error` term is not
- Now, the critical part is that
- In order to have the strictness signature available at call sites, we have to analyse the RHS of the binding before the let body

# Call Context matters 1

- 2 minutes (2:30)
- This restriction is unfortunate in cases like this
- We'll focus on the free variable `z` here
- `f` is called with two arguments
- So the whole expression is strict in `z`
- Our strictness analysis fails to recognise this
- In order to have *some* signature available in the body, our analysis only computes the signature of `f` for manifest arity 1 (the number of leading lambdas)
- Not enough information to look under the inner lambda bindings
- Has to be conservative and assume `z` to be used lazily
- Because of `seq` it may well be that a call to `f` does not evaluate `z` at all
- But in the body, `f` is only ever called with two arguments
- If we had known that we could have computed a more precise signature for that case

# Call Context matters 2

- Obviously, we can't just pre-compute signatures for all possible arities
- The solution is to postpone analysis of the RHS until incoming arity is known
- In this case:  
  - Go straight into the body
  - handle the call to `f` by analysing its RHS with the incoming arity 2
  - In the resulting 'signature', `z` is detected as used strictly
- Formally, what we are doing here is, we approximate the *strictness transformer* of the RHS in finitely many points  
- The strictness transformer of an expression maps incoming arity to the appropriate strictness type
- My first ideas to implement this tried to harness laziness in some clever way to cache strictness types

# Recursion

- 1 minute (1:12)
- Turns out that this completely breaks down when handling recursive bindings
- To compute the strictness type of the `fac`torial function called with one argument, we need the strictness type `fac` called with one argument
- So I rediscovered fixed-point iteration, only that iteration order is no longer dictated by syntactic structure
- To reiterate: Typical analyses within GHC would compute a stable approximation of the RHS, then analyse the body or vice versa
- In constrast, we would descend into the body, then jump to the RHS, then jump back into the body 
- This led me to declare analysis dependencies as a data-flow graph, solve it by worklist agorithm

# Data-flow Graph for Strictness Analysis 1

- 4 minutes (4:30)
- How does this look, conceptually?
- What nodes must be present in the graph we model the problem with?
- We need one root node denoting the whole expression
- Other than that, at the least we need to allocate nodes where we have to break recursion
- One node per pair of let bound expression and incoming arity is sufficient
- We initialise the worklist to only contain that root node
- and assign all nodes a bottom value to start with

# Data-flow Graph for Strictness Analysis 2

1. Now we begin with actually computing a solution, by dequeing the first element of the worklist
1. We invoke the transfer function of the root node and realise that it calls `f` with two arguments in its body  
  - The respective node is $\bot$ and not yet present in the 'call stack'
  - So analysis directly descends into the node, resembling depth-first search
  - This makes sure that we discover the set of reachable nodes as quick as possible
1. `f` recurses into itself in one of its branches  
  - It does so with two arguments, as we analyse under the assumption of incoming arity two
1. Our 'callstack' already contains `f2`  
  - In order to break the dependency cycle, analysis doesn't recurse again
  - Instead we assume the most optimistic strictness type possible
  - which in this case corresponds to the following strictness type
1. We note that `f2` depended on an unstable $\bot$ value by adding it to the worklist
1. Under the assumption of this strictness type for the recursive case, we can join together the results from all three case branches  
  - In the first branch, `f` is lazy in the second argument because of the call to `const`!
  - Put together, we can update `f2`s node with this strictness type, that says
1. With this potentially unstable approximation we jump back into the root node  
  - Where we can unleash the strictness type at the call site of `f`
  - To find out that the first argument `x` to `f` is used strictly, the second argument `y` lazily  
1. Now we can dequeue the next item from the worklist, `f2`, where we needed to break a dependency clycle
1. So we iterate `f2` again,
1. Which again depends on itself  
  - This time there is an approximation available, which we can use
  - So under the assumption of this strictness type, we arrive at exactly the same strictness type
  - Strictness type doesn't change, no further nodes need to be enqueued
1. The worklist is empty and all nodes are stable, done!  
  - By looking at the strictness type of the root node
  - we can see that this expression uses its fv `x` strictly and `y` possibly lazily


# Implementation 1

- 3-4 minutes (2:59)
- That's how we want to look things on the drawing board
- How do we model this elegantly in Haskell?
- My approach was to hide the iteration strategy behind an abstract `TransferFunction` monad  
  - Parameterized by `k`, the type of nodes, and `v`, the denoting lattice
- There's a single impure primitive in that monad: `dependOn`  
  - Expresses a dependency on the node given as the first parameter
  - Returns just the current value of the node
  - Or `Nothing` if its value is currently $\bot$ and the iteration strategy decided to break a cycle
  - In absence of any cycles, the employed iteration strategy just performs a single depth-first traversal
- So that's how we specify a single transfer function

# Implementation 2

- The specification of a data-flow problem contains a transfer function for every node of the data-flow graph
- as well as a `ChangeDetector` which captures the notion of efficiently testing lattice values for changes
  - In the simplest case it's just equality from an `Eq`
  - can make use of domain knowledge such as monotonicity
  - Takes the node, the old value and the new value
- Once a specification for the data-flow problem has been built

# Implementation 3

- The final step will be to pass this specification to `fixProblem`
- `fixProblem` is an interpreter for `DataFlowProblem`s which computes a solution
- It captures a certain iteration strategy
- In our specific case:  
  - Big picture: Iterate all nodes in the work list until they are stable
  - Small tweak: Whenever we hit a $\bot$ node, we analyse it first
  - On the initial graph, where all nodes are $\bot$, it's more like a 
  - Depth-first traversal to discover the set of reachable nodes (e.g. the call graph)
  - nodes end up in the worklist either because of broken cycles or because some dependency changed
- The `fixProblem` function gets passed the `DataFlowProblem` as well as the initial worklist
- The result is a map from nodes to stable denotations  
  - Mostly the value of the root node is of interest

# Applied to Strictness Analysis

- (1:13)
- When applied to strictness analysis, we want to denote expressions by their strictness transformer  
  - that was the map from incoming arity to the corresponding strictness type
- As we saw in the earlier example, we model the strictness transformer point-wise  
  - so there is a strictness type per actual pair of `ExprNode` and `Arity`
- Since `CoreExpr`s/`Id`s don't have an `Ord` instance, we need a separate `ExprNode` type for that  
  - The order is important not only for indexing nodes in the graph, but also determines the priorities within the worklist
  - Nodes need to be allocated as part of building the data-flow graph
  - Possible to do so without leaking the details into the analysis logic
  - Priorities of nodes should respect ordering given by the Occurence Analyser for good analysis performance

# Comparison to hoopl

- 2 minutes (2:13)
- Everything that does data-flow analysis in Haskell should compare to hoopl  
  - For anyone unaware, hoopl stands for 'higher-order optimisation library'
  - is used in GHC's Cmm backend  
- hoopl works on ordinary CFGs  
  - For the better or the worse, our approach is much less restrictive
  - We have seen how to allocate just the minimal number of nodes to break loops
  - Could also allocate a node per subexpression
  - Number of nodes more or less transparent to the analysis logic
  - Allocation of more nodes results in higher degrees of caching but also more book-keeping
  - Edges are declared in code through calls to `dependOn`
  - discovered as transfer functions are executed
- designed to handle imperative languages, hence CFG  
  - whereas our approach is explicitly targeted at expression languages
- In the same veign: hoopl has a rather operational model  
  - Inputs flow into the begin of the basic block, through all instructions and out of the basic block
  - Our approach is more denotational, giving meaning to a composite expression from its parts in some semantic domain  
- Also, hoopl makes the join-semilattice explicit  
  - in having the user specify a bottom value and a join operation
  - which we should probably do too in order to share more analysis logic
- Finally, hoopl is also concerned with a solution for transformations or rewrites 
  - something we currently ignore
  - messes with allocated nodes and their priorities

# Discussion

- 2 minutes (1:44)
- Now for some pros and cons of my approach
- From the plain standpoint of software engineering, separating analysis logic from iteration logic seems like the right thing to do
- Although on the other hand, the coupling currently present in GHC's analysis is not as bad as when whipping up imperative analyses from scratch
- Yet still, the interaction of different abstraction layers obscures intent  
  - When reading through GHC's analysis code
  - 'Is this relevant to analysis logic or just part of fixed-point iteration?'
- As we saw earlier with the call context example, expressing analysis logic and iteration logic as a single iterated tree traversal also makes some ideas impossible to pursue
- Also, optimisations to fixed-point iteration and other 'hacks', such as caching of analysis results between iterations, are encoded in the very nature of data-flow analysis  
  - Iterating bindings in a beneficial order is abstracted in the worklist
- However, it is unclear how compiler performance will be affected  
  - Needs quite some book-keeping to update graph nodes and check for changes
  - On the other hand, it promises even better caching and less performance bugs
  - We can't really tell until we measure, which is on my TODO list for when the code is stable
- Finally, extracting the shared concerns can only really shine if multiple analyses use this model

# Conclusion

- 1-2 minutes (1:33)
- To wrap up
- I pitched what I found to be an interesting idea that came out of my thesis
- The theme was to separate specification of analysis logic from computing the solution of the underlying data-flow problem
- We saw an example for how the solver would compute a stable solution by iterating the data-flow graph
- Apologies if this was all a bit vague, but I have very concrete plans for the future:  
  1. First, recall that for strictness analysis, we denoted expressions by their strictness transformer, which is a monotone function. Currently, we don't take advantage of that at all. What is needed for that to happen, is a map data-structure that is indexed by a partial order, so that we can have arbitrary lattices as keys. You can track my work in this repository
  2. When we have the right data-structure, we need to find a proper way to integrate it into the API. We also need ways to express abortion and other frequent analysis hacks. After some polishing, I plan to actually publish it on hackage
  3. Finally, we can testdrive it in different analyses within GHC and measure how it affects compiler performance
- Even if performance turns out to be bad, I think the approach is probably worth to be considered in hobby projects or when prototyping
